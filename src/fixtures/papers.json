unpredictability of traffic demand has led to a consensus view that the automation of the management process is inevitable. Currently, network and service management techniques are mostly manual, requiring human intervention, and leading to slow response times, high costs, and customer dissatisfaction. In this paper we present AutoNet, a self-organizing management system for core networks where robustness to environmental changes, namely traffic shifts, topology changes, and community of interest is viewed as critical. A framework to design robust control strategies for autonomic networks is proposed. The requirements of the network are translated to graph-theoretic metrics and the management system attempts to automatically evolve to a stable and robust control point by optimizing these metrics. The management approach is inspired by ideas from evolutionary science where a metric, network criticality, measures the survival value or robustness of a particular network configuration. In our system, network criticality is a measure of the robustness of the network to environmental changes. The control system is designed to direct the evolution of the system state in the direction of increasing robustness. As an application of our framework, we propose a traffic engineering method in which different paths are ranked based on their robustness measure, and the best path is selected to route the flow. The choice of the path is in the direction of preserving the robustness of the network to the unforeseen changes in topology and traffic demands. Furthermore, we develop a method for capacity assignment to optimize the robustness of the network.", "times_cited": 0, "source": 6, "authors": [845, 846]}}, {"model": "papers.paper", "pk": 11, "fields": {"doi": "10.1109/TSMCA.2011.2116117", "title": "Spectral Measure of Structural Robustness in Complex Networks", "publication_year": 2011, "abstract": "We introduce the concept of natural connectivity as a measure of structural robustness in complex networks. The natural connectivity characterizes the redundancy of alternative routes in a network by quantifying the weighted number of closed walks of all lengths.

The natural connectivity can be regarded as an average eigenvalue that changes strictly monotonically with the addition or deletion of edges. We calculate both analytically and numerically the natural connectivity of three typical networks: regular ring lattices, random graphs, and random scale-free networks.

Simulation results show that applying RLR to such distribution networks can improve the network robustness on the supply availability and network connectivity metrics when both random and targeted disruptions are likely to occur. A unique feature of our model is a tunable rewiring parameter, which makes it possible to design networks with the same performance on the supply availability, network connectivity, and average delivery efficiency metrics in the presence of both types of disruptions.

Of particular interest are situations where the type of disruption is unknown. Using a military logistic network as a case study, we propose new network resilience metrics that reflect the heterogeneous roles (e.g., supply, relay, and demand) of nodes in supply networks. We also present a hybrid and tunable network growth model called Degree and Locality-based Attachment (DLA), in which new nodes make connections based on both degree and locality. Using computer simulations, we compare the resilience of several supply network topologies that are generated with different growth models.

However, despite the rich information embedded in these networks, these networks face important data quality challenges of noise and incompleteness that adversely affect the results obtained from their analysis. Here, we apply a robust measure of local network structure called common neighborhood similarity (CNS) to address these challenges. Although several CNS measures have been proposed in the literature, an understanding of their relative efficacies for the analysis of interaction networks has been lacking. We follow the framework of graph transformation to convert the given interaction network into a transformed network corresponding to a variety of CNS measures evaluated. The effectiveness of each measure is then estimated by comparing the quality of protein function predictions obtained from its corresponding transformed network with those from the original network.

We demonstrate the efficiency of NRM and RAM in analyzing GRNs and PPINs, respectively, by considering aging- and cancer-related datasets. When applied to an aging-related GRN, our results indicate that such a network is more robust to intrinsic perturbations in the elderly than in the young, and is therefore less responsive to external stimuli. When applied to a PPIN of fibroblast and HeLa cells, we observe that the network of cancer cells possesses better robustness than that of normal cells. Moreover, the response ability of the PPIN calculated from the cancer cells is lower than that from healthy cells.

Consequently, it is now vitally important to evaluate the robustness of such networks in terms of the services supported by the network in question. Evaluating network robustness is integral to service provisioning and thus any network should include explicit indication of the impact upon service performance. Traditionally, network robustness metrics focused solely on topological characteristics, although some new approaches have considered, to a degree, the services supported by such networks. Several shortcomings of these new metrics have been identified. With the purpose of solving the drawbacks of these metrics, this paper presents a new measure called endurance, which quantifies the level of robustness supported by a specific topology under different types of multiple failure scenarios, giving higher importance to perturbations affecting low percentages of elements of a network. In this paper, endurance of six synthetic complex networks is computed for a range of defined multiple failure scenarios, taking into account the connection requests that cannot be satisfied.

While the theoretical approaches emphasize the global characterization of regulatory systems, the practical approaches focus on the role of distinct molecules and genes in regulation. To bridge the gap between these opposite approaches, one needs to combine 'general' with 'particular' properties and translate abstract topological features of large systems into testable functional characteristics of individual components. Here, we propose a new topological parameter - the pairwise disconnectivity index of a network's element - that is capable of such bridging.Results: The pairwise disconnectivity index quantifies how crucial an individual element is for sustaining the communication ability between connected pairs of vertices in a network that is displayed as a directed graph. Such an element might be a vertex (i.e., molecules, genes), an edge (i.e., reactions, interactions), as well as a group of vertices and/or edges. The index can be viewed as a measure of topological redundancy of regulatory paths which connect different parts of a given network and as a measure of sensitivity (robustness) of this network to the presence (absence) of each individual element. Accordingly, we introduce the notion of a path-degree of a vertex in terms of its corresponding incoming, outgoing and mediated paths, respectively. The pairwise disconnectivity index has been applied to the analysis of several regulatory networks from various organisms. The importance of an individual vertex or edge for the coherence of the network is determined by the particular position of the given element in the whole network.Conclusion: Our approach enables to evaluate the effect of removing each element (i.e., vertex, edge, or their combinations) from a network.

An exceptionally large dynamically relevant core network found in Yeast in comparison with the second ensemble points to a strong bias towards a collective organization which is achieved by subtle modifications in the network's degree distributions. We use a Boolean model of regulatory dynamics with various classes of update functions to represent in vivo regulatory interactions. We find that the Yeast's core network has a qualitatively different behavior, accommodating on average multiple attractors unlike typical members of both reference ensembles which converge to a single dominant attractor. Finally, we investigate the robustness of the networks and find that the stability depends strongly on the used function class. The robustness measure is squeezed into a narrower band around the order-chaos boundary when Boolean inputs are required to be nonredundant on each node.

It is seen that biological systems are robust to genetic and environmental changes at all levels of organization. Functions of various organisms are sustained against mutational changes by using alternative pathways. It is also seen that if any one of the paths for production of the same metabolite is hampered, an alternate path tries to overcome this defect and helps in combating the damage.Methodology: Certain physical, chemical or genetic change in any of the precursor substrate of a biochemical reaction may damage the production of the ultimate product. We employ a quantitative approach for simulating this phenomena of causing a physical change in the biochemical reactions by performing external perturbations to 12 metabolic pathways under carbohydrate metabolism in Saccharomyces cerevisae as well as 14 metabolic pathways under carbohydrate metabolism in Homo sapiens. Here, we investigate the relationship between structure and degree of compatibility of metabolites against external perturbations, i.e., robustness. Robustness can also be further used to identify the extent to which a metabolic pathway can resist a mutation event. Biological networks with a certain connectivity distribution may be very resilient to a particular attack but not to another. The goal of this work is to determine the exact boundary of network breakdown due to both random and targeted attack, thereby analyzing its robustness. We also find that compared to various non-standard models, metabolic networks are exceptionally robust. Here, we report the use of a 'Resilience-based' score for enumerating the concept of 'network-breakdown'.

Analysis of how network structure achieves robustness enables one to understand and design cellular systems. It is typically true that all parameters simultaneously differ from their nominal values in vivo, but there have been few intelligible measures to estimate the robustness of a system's function to the uncertainty of all parameters.We propose a numerical and fast measure of a robust property to the uncertainty of all kinetic parameters, named quasi-multiparameter sensitivity (QMPS), which is defined as the sum of the squared magnitudes of single-parameter sensitivities. Despite its plain idea, it has hardly been employed in analysis of biological models. While QMPS is theoretically derived as a linear model, QMPS can be consistent with the expected variance simulated by the widely used Monte Carlo method in nonlinear biological models, when relatively small perturbations are given. To demonstrate the feasibility of QMPS, it is employed for numerical comparison to analyze the mechanism of how specific regulations generate robustness in typical biological models.QMPS characterizes the robustness much faster than the Monte Carlo method, thereby enabling the extensive search of a large parameter space to perform the numerical comparison between alternative or competing models. It provides a theoretical or quantitative insight to an understanding of how specific network structures are related to robustness. In circadian oscillators, a negative feedback loop with multiple phosphorylations is demonstrated to play a critical role in generating robust cycles to the uncertainty of multiple parameters.

In errors nodes are randomly removed along with all their tipping edges, while in attacks the nodes with highest degrees are removed from the network. Interestingly, in many cases, the small-worldness of violated networks increased as more nodes underwent an attack. This indicates an important role of the hub nodes in controlling the small-worldness of Watts-Strogatz networks. The profile of changes in the small-worldness as a result of errors/attacks was independent of network size, while it was influenced by average degree and rewiring probability of Watts-Strogatz model. We also found that the pattern of the changes of the small-worldness in real-world networks is completely different than that of the Watts-Strogatz networks.

In contrast to classical measures that assess the robustness of networks based on the epidemic threshold above which an epidemic takes place, the new measure incorporates the fraction of infected nodes at steady state for all possible effective infection strengths. Through examples, we show that VC provides more insight about the robustness of networks than does the epidemic threshold. We also address the paradoxical robustness of Barabasi-Albert preferential attachment networks. Even though this class of networks is characterized by a vanishing epidemic threshold, the epidemic requires high effective infection strength to cause a major outbreak. On the contrary, in homogeneous networks the effective infection strength does not need to be very much beyond the epidemic threshold to cause a major outbreak. To overcome computational complexities, we propose a heuristic to compute the VC for large networks with high accuracy. Simulations show that the heuristic gives an accurate approximation of the exact value of the VC. Moreover, we derive upper and lower bounds of the new measure.

As a result, cooperation is greatly enhanced when the community structure is described by homogeneous graphs, as cooperators become able to support cooperative groups and retaliate against those with poor achievements by withdrawing donations from them.

The typical design approach implicitly assumes that, once designed, the facilities and the links will always operate as planned. In reality, however, facilities and the links connecting them, fail from time to time due to poor weather, natural or man-made disasters, or a combination of any other factors. This work aims to propose a design framework that addresses the facility and link failures explicitly by accounting for their impact on a network's performance measures of efficiency and robustness.Design/methodology/approach - The study incorporated a robustness metric for evaluating the resiliency of supply chains in the case of a network disruption. This robustness metric is based on expected losses incurred due to network failures. It defines efficiency and robustness in terms of operational cost and expected disruption cost (EDC), respectively. The EDC is defined in terms of loss of opportunity cost incurred due to not meeting demand on time after a disruption has occurred. The study used a scenario planning approach and formulated a mixed integer linear program model with the objective of maximizing both efficiency and robustness. It also evaluates the trade-offs between efficiency and robustness.Findings - The resulting supply chain is much more reliable in the long term since we have shown that a significant amount of robustness can be built into the system without compromising a lot on efficiency.Originality/value - This work demonstrates a methodology which incorporates such disaster scenarios into the design of a supply chain network.

The control range of a node quantifies the size of the subnetwork that the node can effectively control. A related index, called the control range similarity, is also introduced to measure the structural similarity between two nodes. When applying the index of control range to several real-world and synthetic directed networks, it is observed that the control range of the nodes is mainly influenced by the network's degree distribution and that nodes with a low degree may have a high control range. We use the index of control range similarity to detect and analyze functional modules in glossary networks and the enzyme-centric network of homo sapiens.

This step allows us to show that various statistical measures commonly used in complex network analysis can be seen as discrete estimators of newly defined continuous measures of certain complex geometric properties of the attractor on the scale given by epsilon. In particular, we introduce local measures such as the epsilon-clustering coefficient, mesoscopic measures such as epsilon-motif density, path-based measures such as epsilon-betweennesses, and global measures such as epsilon-efficiency. This new analytical basis for the so far heuristically motivated network measures also provides an objective criterion for the choice of epsilon via a percolation threshold, and it shows that estimation can be improved by so-called node splitting invariant versions of the measures.

The NTR incorporates spatial aspects of network topology, network connectivity, and the dynamic rerouting of traffic on roadway links into the prioritization process. The approach is illustrated in practice using the actual road network, travel demand data, and roadway projects from the Chittenden County Regional Planning Commission (CCRPC) of Vermont. Results are discussed in the context of which projects provide the greatest expected travel time benefits for the network as a whole. Implementing more projects does not necessarily result in additional benefits, and the benefits associated with individual projects cannot simply be extrapolated across groups of projects in an additive manner. The evaluation of project groups appears to require a permutation-based approach where sequencing is critically important. The results can be generalized to other road networks and illustrate the spatially complex characteristics of transportation networks and some of the difficulties these characteristics create with respect to prioritizing roadway projects.

We adopt a methodology to evaluate the impact of such events on the network connectivity by employing temporal metrics in order to select and remove nodes based on how critical they are considered for the network. We also define the temporal robustness range, a new metric that quantifies the disruption caused by an attack strategy to a given temporal network. Our results show that in real-world networks, where some nodes are more dominant than others, temporal connectivity is significantly more affected by intelligent attacks than by random failures. Moreover, different intelligent attack strategies have a similar effect on the robustness: even small subsets of highly connected nodes act as a bottleneck in the temporal information flow, becoming critical weak points of the entire system. Additionally, the same nodes are the most important across a range of different importance metrics, expressing the correlation between highly connected nodes and those that trigger most of the changes in the optimal information spreading.

However, in real networks the failure can also occur in links such as dysfunctional power cables and blocked airlines. Accordingly, complementary to the node-robustness measurement (R-n), we propose a link-robustness index (R-l). We show that solely enhancing R-n cannot guarantee the improvement of R-l. Moreover, the structure of an R-l-optimized network is found to be entirely different from that of an onion network.

To achieve this goal, we study two important problems: 1) how to formally measure the functional robustness, and 2) how to improve the functional robustness of a network based on the local interaction of its nodes. First, we derive a utility function in terms of network entropy to characterize the functional robustness of a distribution network. Second, we propose a decentralized network pricing mechanism, where each node need only communicate with its distribution neighbors by sending a \"price\" signal to its upstream neighbors and receiving \"price\" signals from its downstream neighbors. By doing so, each node can determine its outflows by maximizing its own payoff function. Our mathematical analysis shows that the decentralized pricing mechanism can produce results equivalent to those of an ideal centralized maximization with complete information.

This level of coverage is rarely achieved in practice, however, and we have only limited information on the robustness of network measures to incomplete coverage. This paper examines the effect of node-level missingness on 4 classes of network measures: centrality, centralization, topology and homophily across a diverse sample of 12 empirical networks. We use a Monte Carlo simulation process to generate data with known levels of missingness and compare the resulting network scores to their known starting values. As with past studies (Borgatti et al., 2006; Kossinets, 2006), we find that measurement bias generally increases with more missing data. The exact rate and nature of this increase, however, varies systematically across network measures. For example, betweenness and Bonacich centralization are quite sensitive to missing data while closeness and in-degree are robust. Similarly, while the tau statistic and distance are difficult to capture with missing data, transitivity shows little bias even with very high levels of missingness. The results are also clearly dependent on the features of the network. Larger, more centralized networks are generally more robust to missing data, but this is especially true for centrality and centralization measures. More cohesive networks are robust to missing data when measuring topological features but not when measuring centralization. Overall, the results suggest that missing data may have quite large or quite small effects on network measurement, depending on the type of network and the question being posed.

Roughly speaking, stability of these networks implies that the total number of customers/jobs in the network remains bounded over time. In this context robustness characterizes the ability of a multiclass queueing network to remain stable, if the expected values of the interarrival and service times distributions are subject to uncertain shifts. A powerful starting point for the stability analysis of multiclass queueing networks is the associated fluid network. Based on the fluid network analysis we present a measure to quantify the robustness, which is indicated by a single number. This number will be called the stability radius. It represents the magnitude of the smallest shift of the expected value of the interarrival and/or service times distributions so that the associated fluid network looses the property of stability. The stability radius is a worst case measure and is a conceptual adaptation from the dynamical systems literature. Moreover, we provide a characterization of the shifts that destabilize the network. Based on these results, we formulate a mathematical program that minimizes the required network capacity, while ensuring a desired level of robustness towards shifts of the expected values of the interarrival times distributions. This approach provides a new view on long-term robust production capacity allocation in supply chains. The capabilities of our method are demonstrated using a real world supply chain.

To overcome such inconsistency, this work proposes a multi-metric approach as the basis of evaluating aggregate ranking of network topology robustness. This is based on simultaneous utilization of a minimal set of distinct robustness metrics that are standardized so to give way to a direct comparison of vulnerability across networks with different sizes and configurations, hence leading to an initial scoring of inherent topology robustness. Subsequently, based on the inputs of initial scoring a rank aggregation method is employed to allocate an overall ranking of robustness to each network topology.

Surprisingly, we find that only adopting once mitigation mechanism on a small part of the overload nodes can dramatically improve the robustness of scale-free networks. In addition, we also show by numerical simulations that the optimal mitigation method strongly depends on the total capacities of all nodes in a network and the distribution of the load in the cascading model.

Here we develop a new quantitative metric that is analogous to indices used to analyse food-webs and identify key species. The Supply Chain Index (SCI) identifies critical elements as those elements with large throughput rates, as well as greater connectivity. The sum of the scores for a supply chain provides a single metric that roughly captures both the resilience and connectedness of a supply chain. Standardised scores can facilitate cross-comparisons both under current conditions as well as under a changing climate. Identification of key elements along the supply chain may assist in informing adaptation strategies to reduce anticipated future risks posed by climate change. The SCI also provides information on the relative stability of different supply chains based on whether there is a fairly even spread in the individual scores of the top few key elements, compared with a more critical dependence on a few key individual supply chain elements. We use as a case study the Australian southern rock lobster Jasus edwardsii fishery, which is challenged by a number of climate change drivers such as impacts on recruitment and growth due to changes in large-scale and local oceanographic features. The SCI identifies airports, processors and Chinese consumers as the key elements in the lobster supply chain that merit attention to enhance stability and potentially enable growth. We also apply the index to an additional four real-world Australian commercial fishery and two aquaculture industry supply chains to highlight the utility of a systematic method for describing supply chains.

Recent research in ecology has investigated early warning signs that anticipate the divergence of univariate ecosystem dynamics from a stable attractor. To date, leading indicators of instability in systems with multiple interacting components have remained poorly investigated.

To our surprise, however, the experiments on two Internet AS-level topologies show that: Although a k-core-based attack is feasible in reality, it is actually less effective than the classic degree-based attack. Indeed, as indicated by the measure normalized susceptibility, we need to remove 2 % to 3 % more nodes in a k-core-based attack in order to collapse the networks. Further investigation on the nodes in a same shell discloses that these nodes often have drastically varying degrees, among which are the nodes of high k-core values but low degrees.

We explore the robustness of the interdependent networks against cascading failures by two measures, i.e., the critical threshold beta(c) quantifying the whole robustness of the interdependent networks to avoid the emergence of cascading failure, and the new proposed smallest capacity threshold beta(c,s) quantifying the degree of the worst damage of the interdependent networks. We numerically find that the AL (high-degree nodes in network A connect high-degree ones in network B) link between two networks can greatly enhance the robust level of the interdependent networks against cascading failures. Especially we observe that the values of beta(c) in the interdependent networks with both the DL (high-degree nodes in network A connect low-degree ones in network B) link and the RL (nodes in network A randomly connect ones in network B) link increase monotonically with the coupled strength, while the values of beta(c,s) in the interdependent networks with three types of link patterns almost monotonically decreases with the coupled strength. In the interdependent networks with the AL, the value of beta(c) first decreases and then increases with the coupled strength. We further explain this interesting phenomenon by a simple graph. In addition, we study the influence of the coupled strength on the efficiency of two attacks to destroy the interdependent networks. We find that, when the coupled strength between two networks is weaker, attacking the edges with the lower load is more easier to trigger the cascading propagation than attacking the nodes with the higher load, however, when the coupled strength in two networks is stronger, the case is on the contrary.

For this analysis, we have studied the attack robustness of these networks. It has been previously shown that deletion of network vertices in descending order of their importance (e.g., in decreasing order of vertex degrees) can affect the network structure much more considerably. In the current study, we introduced three miRNA-based measures of importance: \"miRNA count\" (i.e., the number of miRNAs that regulate a given network component); average adjacent miRNA count, \"AAmiC\" (i.e., the average number of miRNAs regulating the targeted components adjacent to a given component); and total adjacent miRNA count, \"TAmiC\" (i.e., the total number of miRNAs regulating the targeted components adjacent to a given component). Our results suggest that \"miRNA count\" is only marginally capable of locating the important components of the networks, while TAmiC was the most relevant measure. By comparing TAmiC with the classical centrality measures (which are solely based on the network structure) when simultaneously removing vertices, we show that this measure is correlated to degree and betweenness centrality measures, while its performance is generally better than that of closeness and eigenvector centrality measures. The results of this study suggest that TAmiC which represents a measure based on both network structure and biological knowledge, can successfully determine the important network components indicating that miRNA regulation and network robustness are related.

By considering the potential additional risk from node damage, a non-trivial optimal active dissipation control strategy which minimizes the total cost in the system can be obtained. Under some conditions the introduced control strategy can decrease the total cost in the system compared to the uncontrolled model. Moreover, when the probability of damaging a node experiencing failure tolerance is greater than the critical value, then no matter how successful the active dissipation control is, the total cost of the system will have to increase.

In this work, we are trying to answer the above questions studying the expansion properties of large social graphs. First, we present a measure that characterizes the robustness properties of a graph and also serves as global measure of the community structure (or lack thereof). We show how to compute this measure efficiently by exploiting the special spectral properties of real-world networks. We apply our method on several diverse real networks with millions of nodes, and we observe interesting properties for both static and time-evolving social graphs. As an application example, we show how to spot outliers and anomalies in graphs over time. Finally, we examine how graph generating models that mimic several properties of real-world graphs and behave in terms of robustness dynamics.", "times_cited": 0, "source": 9, "authors": [1235, 1236, 1237]}}, {"model": "papers.paper", "pk": 135, "fields": {"doi": "", "title": "ADAPTIVITY OF COMPLEX NETWORK TOPOLOGIES FOR DESIGNING RESILIENT SUPPLY CHAIN NETWORKS", "publication_year": 2015, "abstract": "Supply chain systems are becoming more complex and dynamic as a result of globalization and the development of information technology. This complexity is characterized by an overwhelming number of relations and their interdependencies, resulting in highly nonlinear and complex dynamic behaviors. Supply chain networks grow and self-organize through complex interactions between their structure and function. The complexity of supply-chain networks creates unavoidable difficulty in prediction making it difficult to manage and control them using a linearized set of models. The aim of this article is to design resilient supply chain network from the perspective of complex network topologies. In this paper, various resilience metrics for supply chains are developed based on a complex network theory, then a resilient supply chain growth algorithm is also developed for designing a resilient supply chain network. An agent-based simulation analysis is carried out to test the developed model based on the resilience metrics. The results of the proposed resilient supply chain growth algorithm are compared with major complex network models. A simulation result shows that a supply chain network can be designed based on complex network theory, especially as a scale-free network. It is also concluded that the proposed model is more suitable than general complex network models for the design of a resilient supply chain network.", "times_cited": 0, "source": 9, "authors": [1238, 1239, 1240, 1241, 1242]}}, {"model": "papers.paper", "pk": 136, "fields": {"doi": "10.1016/j.ijpe.2014.09.036", "title": "Resilience by teaming in supply network formation and re-configuration", "publication_year": 2015, "abstract": "In an increasingly interconnected world, physical, service, and digital supply networks are becoming progressively more complex, dynamic, and interdependent. Moreover, sustainability concerns push for higher efficiency in the use of resources, reducing protective redundancies and making supply networks more susceptible to disruptions. Supply network resilience is an emerging concept related to the inherent ability of a network to tolerate and overcome disruptions, a central capacity to achieve long term-sustainable operations. However, current understanding of the impact of network formation and re-configuration mechanisms on resilience is at its early stages.In this article, resilience by teaming (RBT) association decisions, inspired in the fault-tolerance by teaming principle from Collaborative Control Theory, are characterized and applied in network formation and re-configuration mechanisms. The impact of RBT on emerging supply network topology and resilience under targeted and random disruptions is measured and compared to scenarios were only traditional association rules are applied. Results show that the introduction of supply network agents using RBT association rules significantly (1) increases quality of service (QoS) with no significant cost increase in normal operation, (2) increases post-disruption QoS by 15-30% under random disruptions and 10% under targeted disruptions without cost increase vs. normal operation - when at least 20% of the agents use RBT association rules.

This strategy is based on Structural Centrality (SC) of the node in the network. In this strategy, by using graph spectral analysis of the network, we find the hierarchy of the influential nodes in the form of central nodes in the network. The structural centrality of each node is ranked in the topology of complex networks which are modeled as the scale free networks. We have explored the structural centrality based targeted attack and compared our result with the degree based targeted attack. The robustness of the real world complex network has been measured efficiently against the degree, structural centrality based targeted attack and compared with the random attack and compared it. In the social networks, the mechanism to suppress the harmful rumors is of great importance. A rumor spreading model has been defined using the susceptible-infected-refractory (SIR) model to characterize the rumor propagation in the social networks. Inoculation strategy based on the structural centrality has been applied on the rumor spreading model for the heterogeneous networks. It is compared with the random and degree based targeted inoculations. The nodes with higher structural centrality are chosen for the inoculation in the proposed strategy. The structural centrality based targeted inoculation strategy is found to be more efficient in comparison to the random and degree based targeted inoculation strategies. One of the bottlenecks of this approach is the high complexity in computing the structural centrality of the nodes in the complex networks with very large number of nodes. Further, appearance of giant component has been studied in the network with random attacks, and degree and structural centrality based attacks.

Existing studies mainly focused on the cascading failures and the robustness of coupled networks when the networks suffer from attacks. In reality, it is necessary to recover the damaged networks, and there are cascading failures in recovery processes. In this study, firstly, we analyze the cascading failures of coupled networks during recoveries. Then, a recovery robustness index is presented for evaluating the resilience of coupled networks to cascading failures in the recovery processes. Finally, we propose a technique aiming at protecting several influential nodes for enhancing robustness of coupled networks under the recoveries, and adopt six strategies based on the potential knowledge of network centrality to find the influential nodes. Experiments on three coupling networks demonstrate that with a small number of influential nodes protected, the robustness of coupled networks under the recoveries can be greatly enhanced.", "times_cited": 0, "source": 9, "authors": [1108, 1109, 1110, 1111]}}, {"model": "papers.paper", "pk": 139, "fields": {"doi": "10.1142/S0129183115500308", "title": "Attack robustness of cascading load model in interdependent networks", "publication_year": 2015, "abstract": "Considering the weight of a node and the coupled strength of two interdependent nodes in the different networks, we propose a method to assign the initial load of a node and construct a new cascading load model in the interdependent networks. Assuming that a node in one network will fail if its degree is 0 or its dependent node in the other network is removed from the network or the load on it exceeds its capacity, we study the influences of the assortative link (AL) and the disassortative link (DL) patterns between two networks on the robustness of the interdependent networks against cascading failures. For better evaluating the network robustness, from the local perspective of a node we present a new measure to qualify the network resiliency after targeted attacks. We show that the AL patterns between two networks can improve the robust level of the entire interdependent networks. Moreover, we obtain how to efficiently allocate the initial load and select some nodes to be protected so as to maximize the network robustness against cascading failures. In addition, we find that some nodes with the lower load are more likely to trigger the cascading propagation when the distribution of the load is more even, and also give the reasonable explanation.
